The CHAiNGE is a forum primarily for users to make suggestions on how future google glass and modular phone will be like or how they feel that can be improved about the current features.
Users are allowed to post a trend and post a reply to a trend. 
Users are able to ¡°like or vote¡± once per trend or reply.
Along with this, the RULES are going to be enforced at a more vigorous level.
Please, read the forum rules, and pay attention to them. If you don¡¯t like someone¡¯s idea, please remember to post with respect towards fellow players at all times and remain constructive.
Thus a couple ground rules:
1)	This is a breading ground for ideas. If someone has an idea, listen to it. If you don¡¯t like it, think about why. Constructive feed back is good. Posting ¡°That¡¯s an awful idea,¡± is not constructive.
2)	This is not a forum for known issues. There are links above to the forums that deal with those. If you have an idea of how to improve an issue, that is one thing. If you are simply pointing out flaws and shortcomings, it is not a feature or idea. 
3)	Please put some information regarding your idea in the topic. Topics named things like ¡°An idea¡± or ¡°Does anybody think¡­¡± will be renamed.
4)	This is for Features and Ideas, please put some ideas into it, even if it¡¯s just a suggestion or two to spark a thread.
5)	Before posting an idea, please check the forum(commonly proposed ideas thread) to see if there¡¯s already a topic running for it. Reposts will be locked and routed to the active thread.
